<p>'2018-05-22 - Epic metallers WINTERSUN played their first "by request" shows in Finland last month, where their fans could vote the set list for each concert. Due to their great reception,
the band has now decided to play a couple of select "by request" headline shows outside of their home country in August and November (Austria, Germany & the Netherlands).
Of the upcoming "by request" shows the band comments:
"There's a separate setlist poll for each show and fans planning to attend the shows can vote for any songs from the first three WINTERSUN albums." ' <br/>
<br />
'2018-01-11 - 2017 was a great year for Finnish epic metallers WINTERSUN and their loyal fan base: The band with mastermind Jari Mäenpää didn't only release their third studio album »The Forest Seasons«,
they also played several European festival shows as well as Finnish and European headline tours plus their first ever shows in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and China. Now WINTERSUN are about to conquer European stages once more
 - this time as main support to melodic death giants ARCH ENEMY. Additional support on this trek will come from up and coming Swedes TRIBULATION and Ukrainian metal outfit JINJER. A lot of shows are already completely sold out,
and many other venues are running very low on tickets. So hurry up, grab your tickets and don't miss these powerful evenings! '</p>
